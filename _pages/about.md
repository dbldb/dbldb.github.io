I am a fourth year Ph.D. student at Yale Unversity, studying under Ruzica Piskac and Zhong Shao. My current research focuses on proof systems with an emphasis on the properties of their checker, including checking SMT proofs in zero knowledge and investigating extensible proof systems. My research interests include formal verification and zero knowledge proofs, along with privacy and security and systems programming.

Previously, I received a B.S. from the University of Minnesota in 2021. There, I did undergraduate research under Gopalan Nadathur on a proof system based on a logical framework.
